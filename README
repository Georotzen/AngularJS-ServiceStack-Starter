An AngularJS and ServiceStack starter solution that exemplifies the use of the built in ASP.NET Windows authentication together with ServiceStack webservices.
See this blog post for further details: http://alexvpop.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/angularjs-servicestack.html  

A key part of this project around sharing the ASP.NET session with ServiceStack was taken from a StackOverflow answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/9193782/523296  

UPDATE: This example is now only valid for ServiceStack v3. ServiceStack v4 has now built in support for a Windows Authentication Provider: https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/release-notes.md#windows-auth-provider-for-aspnet
